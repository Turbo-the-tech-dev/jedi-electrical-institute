**Duration:** 2 hours  
**Prerequisites:** None

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- [ ] Understand atomic structure and electron flow
- [ ] Define voltage, current, resistance, and power
- [ ] Apply Ohm's Law to simple circuits
- [ ] Use a multimeter safely

---

## 1. Atomic Structure Review

### Key Concepts
- **Atom**: Smallest unit of matter
- **Electron**: Negatively charged particle
- **Proton**: Positively charged particle
- **Valence shell**: Outermost electron shell

### Conductors vs. Insulators
- **Conductors**: Free electrons (copper, aluminum, silver)
- **Insulators**: Bound electrons (rubber, plastic, glass)

## 2. Electrical Quantities

| Quantity | Symbol | Unit | Formula |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| Voltage | V or E | Volts (V) | Electrical pressure |
| Current | I | Amps (A) | Electron flow rate |
| Resistance | R | Ohms (Ω) | Opposition to flow |
| Power | P | Watts (W) | Rate of energy use |

## 3. Ohm's Law

### The Magic Triangle
```
    V
   / \
  I   R
```

### Formulas
- **V = I × R** (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
- **I = V / R** (Current = Voltage / Resistance)
- **R = V / I** (Resistance = Voltage / Current)

### Power Formula
- **P = V × I** (Power = Voltage × Current)

## 4. Practice Problems

### Problem 1
A circuit has 120V and 10A. What is the resistance?

**Solution:**
```
R = V / I
R = 120V / 10A
R = 12 Ω
```

### Problem 2
A heater draws 15A at 240V. What is the power consumption?

**Solution:**
```
P = V × I
P = 240V × 15A
P = 3600W or 3.6kW
```

## 6. Safety First

### Always Remember
- ⚠️ Treat all circuits as energized
- ⚠️ Use proper PPE (safety glasses, insulated tools)
- ⚠️ Never work alone on energized equipment
- ⚠️ Lock out / Tag out (LOTO) before servicing
